Viacoin Core 0.10
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[Viacoin Core](http://viacoin.org/) is the original Viacoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Viacoin transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once. If you would like the process to go faster you can [download the blockchain directly](bootstrap.md).

Build Quickstart
----------------

See the quickstart guide to compile on Debian/Ubuntu [here](build-quickstart.md).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Bitcoin on your native platform. 

### Unix

You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run Viacoin-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:

	sudo apt-get install libqtgui4

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/viacoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit) or bin/32/viacoind (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/viacoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit) or bin/64/viacoind (headless, 64-bit)



### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run viacoin-qt.exe.

### OSX

Drag Viacoin-Qt to your applications folder, and then run Viacoin-Qt.
